<h1>NLP based Question Answering (QA) System for custom KG</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
Question Answering systems utilize information retrieval techniques to retrieve the most relevant information based upon a user query in natural language posed against various data sources like knowledge graphs, relational databases, or documents.

In this project, we propose a Question Answering system that can answer factoid questions using a knowledge graph that will allow us to scale the number of entities and relationships among them. This system accepts user questions in natural language and uses Natural Language Processing techniques to understand the question and produce answers by querying the knowledge graph. The project will also give the user the ability to customize the system by providing support for the usage of custom knowledge graphs.
