# Python Backend (Using Flask)

# To run backend:

Go inside the backend folder and run following commands: First set python version as 3

# To setup basic python environment

pip install virtualenv
virtual env
source env/bin/activate

# Install all dependencies

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

If the backend dependencies are not set up properly, then as an alternative, run following commands at the root of backend folder:

## Flask is used for writing REST API's in python just like express and Node in JS

## <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-build-a-rest-api-using-flask/>

sudo pip3 install flask-restful

sudo pip3 install -U flask-cors

sudo pip3 install -U python-dotenv <https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/>

sudo pip3 install -U requests

Note: Python3 is a pre-req for this to run in any system. Check if pip3 is also there.
